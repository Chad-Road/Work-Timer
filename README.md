# Tkinter-Work-Timer
## A simple work timer and task counter

This was originally built to make time management a little easier for those with more than a smidge of ADHD (like myself). It was originally necessary so students could have multiple separate timers running at the same time that could be independently started and stopped and would count past zero so you could get an idea of total time spent on each project.

The main functions are:
1. Standard timers with custom names that count past zero
2. A stopwatch to count down from some pre-set time
3. A task counter that can be set to count up or down depending on preference

I intended to add a pickling funciton to save timers without needing to hardcode them in, but over time I've discovered that people tend to be more honest with themselves if they can't easily adjust project time to something easier. I may still do this later, but for now I encourage you to view my laziness as feature rather than a bug.
